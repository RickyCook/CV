Objectives
----------
I'm a self-confessed and passionate technologist and geek. I love technology,
and I love working with technology to see how far it can be pushed. As such, I
love keeping up with all the new things that are happening in the tech sphere, 
both in my professional life and to relax at home with. In a career, I want to
be able to explore opportunities to implement and design new and interesting
solutions to the problems we face every day, or simply that grind on us to do
manually.

Code Skills
-----------
My core skillset that I have been using for the past 3 years has been centred
around Python, Django, JavaScript, Perl and Mojolicious. Prior to this, my main
competencies were a combination of PHP and Java with many and various
frameworks in both. Though most of my experiences lie with back-end specifics
of RESTful micro services, I have also been heavily involved with UI
maintenance and development in YUI and jQuery.

Application Skills
------------------
I am a competent and passionate Linux user, with my OS of choice being Arch
Linux for the desktop, and Debian on servers. I have prior, limited experience
with Fedora, and FreeBSD so feel comfortable around most flavours of `*nix`
OSes that are available.

Writing code or a CV makes no difference; My editor will likely be the same. I
use Sublime Text, with a number of plugins to help.

Over the past years, I have been exposed to some truly amazing technologies. 
Recently, of particular note are Docker (and raw LXC/AuFS at a lower level),
ElasticSearch, Gunicorn and PostGIS. All of these have proven an enormous boon
to the projects that have been using them.

Employment History
------------------
**2012-2014** - Web Applications Developer, Infoxchange Australia
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**Technologies:** Python, Django, Docker, ElasticSearch, PostgreSQL, LESS,
CSS3, HTML5, jQuery, YUI, Debian, Perl, Mojolicious, and many, *many* more.

Responsibilities
````````````````
- Develop and debug complex web applications in environments with  both legacy
  and cutting edge technology, using agile methods.
- Judge and create releases as part of a CI/CD process, run retrospectives and
  generally participate in a highly flexible and free agile team.

Achievements
````````````
- Months before Docker was released, I was tasked with building a new CI server
  for the team. My solution was an LXC-based container system that used AuFS
  for the root file system and was managed by Puppet in the background. This
  set Infoxchange on a path to very quickly adopt Docker when it was released.
  I then did a talk on my solution at Infracoders Melbourne [1]_.
- Played a vital role redeveloping Infoxchange's legacy search application from
  the ground up using Docker, ElasticSearch and Django. Again, this lead to
  a talk (that at time of writing has yet to be given) at the Melbourne Search
  user's group [2]_

**2009-2012** - Systems Developer, myPanda Finance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**Technologies:** PHP5, Java 7, Ubuntu, Apache2, MySQL, CSS3, HTML5, Bouncy
Castle

Responsibilities
````````````````
- Managing my own time to develop software and algorithms for statistical
  analysis, data display, connection to brokers, automated/assisted trading,
  and transformation of data between formats.
- Selecting technology (both hardware, and off the shelf software and
  libraries) that suited project needs.
- Designing databases and software to link projects together to share
  data between each other.

Achievements
````````````
- Developed a data visualizer for 4-dimensional (3 dimensions and a heat map)
  statistical data analysis. This was a particular success because of the
  insight it gave into market trend analysis.
- Created an abstraction framework that allowed creation of trade applications
  and tools in both real (via RPC to proprietary broker software), or mocked
  environments using the same interfaces.

**2011-2012** - Web Developer/Systems Administrator, Hotpot Creative
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**Technologies:** AWS (EC2, Route56, EBS, VPC), Nginx, MySQL, Courier Email,
PHP5, PHP-FPM, HTML5, CSS3, MooTools, jQuery, Concrete 5, WordPress

Responsibilities
````````````````
- Researched technologies to make the process of creating websites for clients
  a lot easier, and to increase the value of the end product to the client.
- Setup and maintained the Nginx-based EC2 servers used to host client websites
  (this included high use of EBS volumes so that client sites can be switched
  between servers depending on load).

Achievements
````````````
- The server setup that I did for Hotpot was a major achievement. The PHP and
  JavaScript that wrote, I was absolutely confident with because I have planned
  and implemented solutions for years. The servers however were my first time
  using AWS, and they turned out beautifully.

Education
---------
**2008-2009** - Swinburne University of Technology, Hawthorn, Victoria
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Studied a double degree (incomplete): Bachelor of Science (Computer Science and
Software Engineering) / Bachelor of Multimedia (Games and Interactivity).

This course gave me a stable footing in systems design, usability design, Java
programming, C and C++ programming, 3D modeling and various other facets of the
game development profession. 

**2002-2007** - Yarra Valley Grammar, Ringwood, Victoria
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
