Objectives
----------
I'm a self-confessed and passionate technologist and geek. I love working with
technology to see how far it can be pushed. I try to keep up with as many new
things that are happening in the tech sphere as I can,  both in my professional
life and for personal projects in my down time. I'm looking for a career that
will allow me to explore opportunities to implement and design new and
interesting solutions to the problems we face every day.

Code Skills
-----------
The core skillset that I have been using for the past 3 years has been centred
around Python, Django, JavaScript, Perl and Mojolicious. Prior to this, my main
competencies were a combination of PHP and Java with a variety of frameworks in
both. Most of my experiences lie with back-end specifics of RESTful micro
services, though I have also been heavily involved with UI maintenance and
development in YUI and jQuery.

Application Skills
------------------
I am a competent and passionate Linux user, with a solid knowledge of Arch
Linux for the desktop, and Debian on servers. I also have some experience with
Fedora, and FreeBSD and feel comfortable around most of the `*nix` OS flavours
that are available.

Over the past years, I have been exposed to some truly amazing technologies. Of
particular note are Docker (and raw LXC/AuFS at a lower level), ElasticSearch,
Gunicorn and PostGIS. These have proven an enormous boon to the projects that
have implemented them.
