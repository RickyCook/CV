Objectives
----------
I'm a self-confessed and passionate technologist and geek. I love working with
technology to see how far it can be pushed. I try to keep up with as many new
things that are happening in the tech sphere as I can,  both in my professional
life and for personal projects in my down time. I'm looking for a career that
will allow me to explore opportunities to implement and design new and
interesting solutions to the problems we face every day.

Code Skills
-----------
The core skillset that I have been using for the past 3 years has been centred
around Python, Django, Puppet, and AWS. Prior to this, my main competencies
were a combination of Perl, PHP, and Java with a variety of frameworks in
all. Most of my experiences lie with back-end specifics of RESTful micro
services, though I have also been heavily involved with UI maintenance and
development in YUI and jQuery.

Application Skills
------------------
I am a competent and passionate Linux user, with a solid knowledge of Arch
Linux for the desktop, and Debian on servers. I also have some experience with
RHEL, and FreeBSD and feel comfortable around most of the `*nix` OS flavours
that are available.

Over the past years, I have been exposed to some truly amazing technologies. Of
particular note are Docker (and raw LXC/AuFS at a lower level), ElasticSearch,
Gunicorn and PostGIS. These have proven an enormous boon to the projects that
have implemented them.

| - Months before Docker was released, I was tasked  | LESS, YUI, Mojolicios, |
|   with building a new CI server for the team. My   | HHVM, Puppet           |
|   solution was an LXC-based container system that  |                        |
|   used AuFS for the root file system and was       | And many, *many* more  |
|   managed by Puppet in the background. This set    |                        |
|   Infoxchange on a path to very quickly adopt      |                        |
|   Docker when it was released. I then did a talk   |                        |
|   on my solution at Infracoders Melbourne [1]_.    |                        |

|   legacy search application from the ground up     |                        |
|   using Docker, ElasticSearch and Django. Again,   |                        |

|   dimensions and a heat map) statistical data      |                        |
|   analysis. This was a particular success because  |                        |
|   of the insight it gave into market trend         |                        |
