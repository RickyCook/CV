Objectives

Code Skills
-----------
My core skillset that I have been using for the past 3 years has been centred
around Python, Django, JavaScript, Perl and Mojolicious. Prior to this, my main
competencies were a combination of PHP and Java with many and varies frameworks
in both. Though most of my experiences lie with back-end specifics of RESTful
micro services, I have also been heavily involved with UI maintenance and
development in YUI and jQuery.

Application Skills
------------------
I am a competant and passionate Linux user, with my OS of choice being Arch
Linux for the desktop, and Debian on servers. I have prior, limited experience
with Fedora, and FreeBSD so feel comfortable around most flavours of *nix OSes
that are available.

Writing code or a CV makes no difference; My editor will likely be the same. I
use Sublime Text, with a number of plugins to help.

Over the past years, I have been exposed to some truly amazing technologies. 
Recenty, of particular note are Docker (and raw LXC/AuFS at a lower level), 
ElasticSearch, Gunicorn and PostGIS. All of these have proven an enormous boon
to the projects that have been using them.
