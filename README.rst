Objectives
----------
I'm a self-confessed and passionate technologist and geek. I love working with
technology to see how far it can be pushed. I try to keep up with as many new
things that are happening in the tech sphere as I can, both in my professional
life and for personal projects in my down time. I'm looking for a career that
will allow me to explore opportunities to implement and design new and
interesting solutions to the problems we face every day.

Code Skills
-----------
The core skillset that I have been using for the past 3 years has been centred
around Python, Docker, Puppet, and AWS. Prior to this, my main competencies
were a combination of Perl, PHP, and Java with a variety of frameworks in
all. Most of my experiences lie with both software, and platform back-end
specifics of componentized RESTful services, though I have also been involved
with UI maintenance using Knockout, and React

Application Skills
------------------
I am a competent and passionate Linux user, with a solid knowledge of Arch
Linux for the desktop, as well as Debian, and RHEL on servers. I feel
comfortable around all of the `*nix` OS flavours that I've been faced with.

Over the past years, I have been exposed to some truly amazing technologies. Of
particular note are Docker (and raw LXC/AuFS at a lower level), ElasticSearch,
Gunicorn and PostGIS. These have proven an enormous boon to the projects that
have implemented them.
